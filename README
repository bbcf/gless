Graphical "less" for track files (bed, bedgraph etc.).

Installation:
* Type "git clone git@github.com:delafont/gless.git" at the location where you want to install it.
* Set your PATH environment variable to the same location.
* Run "gless" on the command-line, "gless -h" for usage instructions.
* More documentation in the doc/_build/html folder.

If the library `bbcflib` is found on your system, `btrack` will be used and will
recognize .bed, .bedgraph, .wig, .sga, .bigWig, .sql, .sam formats. Else it can still
read .bed and .bedGraph files.
